# Silent Hill - Visual Novel

# This is made by Jackson Montgomery and Sean Edgar.
# It is a Visual Novel made using the swing libraries, specifically JFrame and subsequent components.

# The current state is a late beta. It is playable and effectively bug-free, and provides about 45 minutes of gameplay.
# The major difference between the current state and the final version is a refactoring of code, and finishing of story.
